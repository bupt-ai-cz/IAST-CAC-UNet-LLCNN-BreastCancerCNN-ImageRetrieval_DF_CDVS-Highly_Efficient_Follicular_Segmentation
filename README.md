# IAST-CAC-UNet-LLCNN-BreastCancerCNN-ImageRetrieval_DF_CDVS-Highly_Efficient_Follicular_Segmentation

## This repo. provides a list of implementations (including codes or dataset) for our previous papers. Most of the implementations were forked form the members of our group. However, the maintenance of the implementations will be based on the following list:

### [IAST: Instance Adaptive Self-training for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (ECCV 2020)](https://github.com/bupt-ai-cz/IAST)

### [CAC-UNet: Multi-level-colonoscopy-malignant-tissue-detection-with-adversarial-CAC-UNet](https://github.com/bupt-ai-cz/CAC-UNet)

### [LLCNN: A convolutional neural network for low-light image enhancement](https://github.com/bupt-ai-cz/LLCNN)
